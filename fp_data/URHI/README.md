# UHRI analyses

This folder contains code and outputs from analyzing Senegal UHRI data. Usage is simply
```python
python analyze_UHRI.py
```

If you haven't run this code before, you will need to add your username and data folder so it can find and load the data. After the first load, it will save an HDF file containing the data so it doesn't have to be re-read.
