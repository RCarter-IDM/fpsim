Coming soon
-----------
- Converting model to array-based implementation, which should increase performance by a factor of roughly 100.
- Adding a ``calib.calibrate()`` method.


Version 0.5.1 (2021-05-05)
--------------------------
- Added ``summarize()`` and ``to_json()`` methods to ``Calibration``. Also added an ``fp.diff_summaries()`` method for comparing them.
- Added regression and benchmarking tests (current total time: 24 s).
- Added a code coverage script (current code coverage: 59%).
- Added default flags for which quantities to compute.
- Split the logic of ``Calibration`` out into more detail: e.g., initialization, running, and post-processing.
