README

create_baseline_data.py is intended to compare model runs between different versions
of the model. It has a few options which can be reviewed via --help:

-n for new baseline (create table from current model version)
-c for make comparison table (add results from new model version to existing table)
-r to replace baseline data (replace table with ONLY results from current model version)

plot_sims.py is intended to plot a comparison of runs of two versions of the model.
Both versions are run multiple times and the result can be shown by just running the file
OR with the -t addition to plot the resulting distributions over each timestep. You
can also access the other options via --help
