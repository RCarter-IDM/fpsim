# fp_analyses

Code for analyzing family planning data.

Although most things are intended as single-use scripts, there are some reusable components, which is why this is provided as a Python package installable via `python setup.py develop`.

* `fp_data` contains some data and functions/scripts to analyze it.
* `fp_dtktools`, `fp_idmtools`, and `fp_pyemod` represent three different options for running EMOD-FP.
* `fp_serialization` is an example of how to serialize an EMOD-FP population.
